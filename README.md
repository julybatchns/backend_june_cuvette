#### Node JS

- 1.  Node.js is a runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript on the server side, outside of a browser. It uses the V8 JavaScript engine (the one that powers Google Chrome), enabling JavaScript to perform backend operations like reading files, handling requests, interacting with databases, etc.

- 2. Non-blocking I/O: Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking architecture, which makes it ideal for building scalable network applications.

- 3. Single-threaded: Node.js uses a single thread to handle multiple requests concurrently by using asynchronous programming.

- 4. Modules: Node.js uses the CommonJS module system to import and export code between files.

### HTTP

- 1. HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) is the foundation of any data exchange on the web and a key concept when working with Express.js, a web framework for Node.js. In Express, you will often deal with requests and responses that conform to the HTTP protocol.

- 2. HTTP Methods

* GET: Retrieve information.
* POST: Submit data to be processed.
* PUT: Update a resource.
* DELETE: Remove a resource.
* PATCH: Partially update a resource.
