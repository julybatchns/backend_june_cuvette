#### Node JS

- 1.  Node.js is a runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript on the server side, outside of a browser. It uses the V8 JavaScript engine (the one that powers Google Chrome), enabling JavaScript to perform backend operations like reading files, handling requests, interacting with databases, etc.

- 2. Non-blocking I/O: Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking architecture, which makes it ideal for building scalable network applications.

- 3. Single-threaded: Node.js uses a single thread to handle multiple requests concurrently by using asynchronous programming.

- 4. Modules: Node.js uses the CommonJS module system to import and export code between files.
